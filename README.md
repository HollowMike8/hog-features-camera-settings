Project to develop an ML model (linear regression/NN..etc) to predict the output for the given input as accurately as possible

### Hyperparameter optimization/tuning:
1. learning rate
2. hidden units/beta_1/mini batch size
3. add hidden layers

### Trial_1:
##### Parameters:
alpha = 0.1 ; n_layers NN = 2 ; hidden_units_1 = 6
##### Observation:
Training loss and validation loss are close enough
##### Next Steps:
Try different learning rates
